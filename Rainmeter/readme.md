My Rainmeter skins. Adds a transparent frame around blackbox bar to match my visual style.
Custom slideshow frame cycles through all images in a directory (including sub directories if chosen) every 30 seconds.
Intended for use along specific tiling layouts.
Pictured: bbinterface + bbleanbar; surrounding transparent frame and underlying shadow are the rainmeter skins.
Transparent frame + image docked on side is the custom slideshow frame.
